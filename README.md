# Stellar-Structure
Using numerical integration to solve equilibrium equations of stars and investigate main sequence properties with a focus on simulating the effect of different nuclear fusion parameters. 

"project_description.pdf" outlines the project requirements and description we followed, with our individual project being for the nuclear team. "Stars_Final_Project_Presentation.pdf" summarizes our work.
